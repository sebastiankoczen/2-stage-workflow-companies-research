    "Okay, I understand the task. I will act as a supply chain market intelligence researcher and identify 20 Swiss companies (or companies with a strong Swiss presence) within the specified industries and revenue range, excluding the listed companies exceeding $15B in revenue. I will then investigate each company for the four situations (Resource Constraints, Margin Pressure, Significant Growth, and Supply Chain Disruption) using the provided search queries, rules, and scoring logic. I will provide a structured research block for each company, including evidence with URLs and publication dates, and calculate the final scores and tier.\n\nBefore I begin, I need to generate a list of potential companies to research.\n\nBased on the search results, here is a list of potential companies, keeping in mind the revenue range (USD 0.5B to 15B) and excluding Roche, Novartis, Nestlé, ABB, Zurich Insurance, Swiss Re, and UBS:\n\n1.  Lindt & Sprüngli (Food & Beverage)\n2.  Emmi AG (Food & Beverage)\n3.  Bell Food Group (Food & Beverage)\n4.  Aryzta AG (Food & Beverage)\n5.  Hero Group (Food & Beverage)\n6.  Sika AG (Chemicals)\n7.  Schindler (Industrial Manufacturing)\n8.  DKSH (FMCG & Consumer Goods)\n9.  Barry Callebaut (Food & Beverage)\n10. Coca-Cola HBC (Food & Beverage)\n11. Sandoz (Pharmaceuticals)\n12. ALSO (Technology)\n13. Aptiv (Automotive Components)\n14. Kühne + Nagel (Logistics)\n15. Coop (Retail)\n16. Migros (Retail)\n17. Autoneum (Automotive Components)\n18. Tetra Pak (Packaging)\n19. Oetiker Group (Automotive Components)\n20. Idorsia Pharmaceuticals (Pharmaceuticals)\n\nNow I will start researching each company for the four situations.\n\n---\n\nCOMPANY: Lindt & Sprüngli\nHQ: Switzerland\nINDUSTRY: Food & Beverage (Chocolate)\nREVENUE: Approx. USD 6B (CHF 5.2B)\n\nSITUATION 1 — RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS:\n- Signal: High volume of SC/Proc vacancies without urgency keywords | Strength: MEDIUM | Score: +1\n  Evidence: Lindt & Sprüngli's career page lists various job openings, including a \"Customer Supply Chain Co-op - Winter 2025\" and \"Industrial Performance Director\". While these listings indicate hiring activity, the lack of urgency keywords suggests a persistent need rather than a crisis.\n  Date: 2024-11-25 | Source: Dayforce Jobs | URL: https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFBzh92TQf8pHmrZnFBoHeKmKIh1NWjrmbqwwAT0c0TNS25Xc5g6IDj9m2DFtRzCjcbCAArLIEdFgJyJGBa81OaU-sK32_bKhE8n6ujt6kaVqedakTgpNF_SMUu_qr90qxKMJbYVlcbdRINbHWyPwrU1IonzuCSTrtWCmTzoNKNY7nAhWAQvWRPPbaDf70llOLiMeBnmEOHeCTX3OZOFVsw6EeydLC3hrDLNOhkrVFNdR3Pg6HarfsxRg==\n  Date: 2026-02-26 | Source: Lindt & Sprüngli Careers | URL: https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQELLGi_vBUELHhHT5v9ZyG4s5PXLqKBsejkVhYUf5BkNqQxXjhe9KBYWCk3f_BLhJpOBHEWr-cq9HIHUzCr2hcJ9_dWC7OpRx5mfI3eDvWDqGBV1wQfMzeOQ5_JZgc7abxThdMtUADACJllHdP59cLWDAnf3xuSKEEJAA==\n\nSITUATION 2 — MARGIN PRESSURE:\n -"
