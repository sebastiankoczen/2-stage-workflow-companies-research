7) Constraints & Boundaries (for deterministic targeting)
Ideal client size range (qualitative if numbers missing)
Likely fit: organizations that need rapid execution capacity in Supply Chain (temporary expertise injection, task-force style), especially in the stated focus industries (Consumer Goods, Pharma & Life Sciences, Chemicals & Industrial Goods). 
Numeric revenue/employee thresholds: Unknown / Not disclosed.
What is OUT of scope / not a strong fit (based on stated model and positioning)
Engagements expecting classic “strategy-only” consulting outputs (frameworks, slide decks) without hands-on implementation. 
Work that requires large-scale pyramid staffing with heavy junior leverage (their model explicitly differentiates away from this). 
What types of projects they likely should avoid (deterministic guidance)
Multi-year, highly standardized global rollouts requiring large permanent delivery organizations (no evidence of such scale model disclosed; they emphasize a flexible network and rapid deployment). 
Pure technology implementation projects where success depends primarily on proprietary software/platform ownership (no proprietary tech offering disclosed on-site).
