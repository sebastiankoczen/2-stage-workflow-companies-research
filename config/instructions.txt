A) Situation Definitions (research-oriented)
1) RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS
Definition (operational)
Company shows insufficient execution capacity (people/bandwidth) in Supply Chain and/or Procurement
Capability gap: missing specialized expertise required to deliver initiatives (not just to design them)
Execution backlog persists despite “clear priorities” or announced programs
Evidence must show internal resourcing shortfall, not external demand/supply shocks
What it is NOT (avoid false positives)
Not a temporary peak workload caused only by seasonality
Not general “hiring” for growth (normal scaling)
Not project delays caused mainly by unclear governance, strategy uncertainty, or budget freeze
Not a supply disruption (that’s Situation 4)
Not margin-driven layoffs (that’s Situation 2)
Why it creates an execution need (task-force fit)
Requires rapid injection of senior doers to unblock delivery
Need for interim capacity in PMO / workstreams without increasing fixed headcount
Needs embedded execution to stabilize + run transformation while BAU continues 

2) MARGIN PRESSURE
Definition (operational)
Profitability declines or stays structurally weak due to cost inflation, inefficiency, pricing pressure
Company explicitly announces cost reduction / productivity / cash protection measures
Margin deterioration is not explained solely by planned investment for growth
Typically evidenced through management statements and financial results
What it is NOT (avoid false positives)
Not “growth investment” phase with strong profitability maintained
Not a one-off exceptional event without continuation (unless reconfirmed)
Not pure FX impact with otherwise stable margins
Not disruption-driven service failure only (Situation 4)
Not resource lack without financial stress (Situation 1)
Why it creates an execution need (task-force fit)
Requires fast execution of cost-out, procurement savings, operating model changes
Needs experienced practitioners to deliver measurable savings quickly
Internal teams often too stretched to execute while maintaining performance

3) SIGNIFICANT GROWTH
Definition (operational)
Company shows rapid growth in revenue, production volumes, footprint or channels
Growth creates operational scaling pressure (capacity, service levels, inventory, supplier capability)
Evidence shows expansion initiatives (plants/DCs, new markets, M&A integration, product launches)
Growth outpaces operational maturity / systems
What it is NOT (avoid false positives)
Not stable or low growth with routine hiring
Not pure share price growth without operational scaling evidence
Not growth driven only by short-lived commodity pricing
Not disruption-related volume spikes from shortages elsewhere (unless sustained)
Not margin pressure disguised as “growth story”
Why it creates an execution need (task-force fit)
Need to scale execution fast without building permanent structures
High demand for planning, procurement, manufacturing, logistics execution
Integration + footprint changes require temporary expert task forces 

4) SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION
Definition (operational)
Company experiences severe, active disruption affecting service, supply continuity, capacity, logistics
Evidence includes shortages, delays, shutdowns, supplier failure, quality incidents, forced re-sourcing
Disruption has material business impact: lost sales, missed guidance, customer penalties, inventory shock
Requires stabilization actions beyond normal operations
What it is NOT (avoid false positives)
Not normal lead time variability
Not margin pressure without supply failure
Not internal capacity constraints unrelated to external disruptions
Not planned shutdowns / routine maintenance
Not generic “risk” statements without observable events
Why it creates an execution need (task-force fit)
Need for rapid “SWAT” execution: supplier stabilization, expediting, re-planning, alternative sourcing
Requires cross-functional task force to restore service and control costs
Internal teams often overwhelmed during crisis periods

C) How to Find Evidence (search guidance)
Research workflow (priority order)
ALLOWED SOURCES:  

Tier 1:  
- Regulatory filings  
- Earnings call transcripts (third-party hosted)  
- Financial statements reported by trusted media  

Tier 2:  
- Reuters  
- Bloomberg  
- Financial Times  
- Industry trade publications  

Tier 3 (supporting only):  
- Reputable business news outlets  

EXCLUDED:  
- Company websites  
- Investor relations pages  
- Vendor blogs  

- Generic AI or SWOT analyses

C) Validation rules — UPDATED (mandatory fields + clickable URL)
Always capture for each counted signal:
Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
Direct quote (≤ 25 words, verbatim)
Source link as clickable URL (must be a full URL starting with https://...)
Validation requirements:
Reject undated articles or pages without publication date
Avoid recycled news: if evidence is older than {X} months, only use it if reconfirmed recently with a new dated source
Prefer evidence where management explicitly connects cause → impact:
“because of X, we experienced Y”
Cross-check:
if trade media reports disruption → confirm in investor comms
Avoid misleading / recycled news
Reject articles that:
have no date
reuse older events without confirmation
cite unnamed “sources close to the matter” as primary evidence
Use “after:” or “site:” operators:
company name supply disruption after:2024-08-01
Treat syndications carefully (one original source, many copies)

E) Scoring Logic (simple + deterministic)
Signal scoring
STRONG signal found = +2 points
MEDIUM signal found = +1 point
Counting rules (strict)
Each counted signal must have ≥ 1 source link
The same signal can be counted only once even if repeated across sources
Each situation scored independently (no spillover points)
Situation thresholds
CONFIRMED: ≥ 10 points 
LIKELY: 6–9 points 
UNCLEAR: 3–5 points 
NOT PRESENT: 0–2 points
