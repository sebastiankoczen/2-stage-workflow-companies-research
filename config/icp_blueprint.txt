1) ICP in 3 Lines**

* **Target:** Companies with complex supply chains facing critical execution gaps where internal capabilities are insufficient to meet strategic demands.
* **Need:** They require immediate, high-level operational support to bridge the divide between strategic design and "hands-on" implementation.
* **Win:** We win by deploying a flexible, practitioner-led task force that integrates directly into client teams rather than delivering theoretical advisory.

2) Best-Fit Client Characteristics (Max 8)**

* **Operational Complexity:** Organizations managing multi-tier supply chains with significant planning, sourcing, or logistics intricacies.
* **Siloed Functions:** Companies struggling to connect planning, procurement, and manufacturing, requiring cross-functional integration.
* **Flexible Resourcing Model:** Openness to hybrid engagement models (interim, freelance network) rather than rigid traditional consulting pyramids.
* **Transformation Readiness:** Organizations aware of their maturity gaps and ready to invest in process optimization (e.g., IBP/S&OP/S&OE, category execution, manufacturing excellence, logistics footprint).
* **Pragmatic culture: prefers “day-one impact” and rapid progress over perfection.
* **Cross-functional complexity (interdependencies between operations, procurement, planning, manufacturing, logistics).

3) Typical Triggers (Max 8)**

* **Sudden Capacity Gaps:** Hiring freezes, unexpected departures of key SC leaders, or inability to recruit niche expertise quickly.
* **EBITDA/Cost Mandates:** Urgent pressure to reduce COGS, optimize inventory, or improve procurement savings to meet financial targets.
* **M&A Activity:** Post-merger integration requiring rapid harmonization of disparate supply chain networks and processes.
* **Rapid Scaling:** Growth outacing the current operational infrastructure, requiring immediate process upgrades or network redesign.
* **Performance Degradation:** Service level drops or logistics failures creating a "burning platform" for immediate remediation.
* **Digital Stagnation:** inability to implement digital tools (e.g., planning software) due to a lack of underlying process maturity.
* **Strategic Initiatives:** Launch of sustainability goals or category management overhauls without dedicated internal project leads.
* **Crisis Response:** External disruptions (geopolitical, raw material) requiring a "war room" or task force approach.
* **A strategic initiative exists, but execution is behind plan (delivery gap).
* **Operating performance requires urgent improvement (service level, inventory, cost, productivity).
* **Major transformation requiring temporary “extra muscles and brains” to deliver workstreams.
